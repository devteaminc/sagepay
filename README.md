This package is a composer-compatible version of the offfical Sagepay PHP integration pack taken from http://www.sagepay.co.uk/support/integration-kits-protocols-document

It has been created as Sagepay are currently not accepting bug reports to their code, and are unwilling to update it.

Much of the code is directly taken from their code, with changes made purely to make their code production(ish)-ready.
